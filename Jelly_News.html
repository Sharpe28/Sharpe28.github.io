According to Darylll S.Parker, a Swat officer whose squad had raided the Kraft factory,"We infiltrated the factory around 11:29am, where we found the perpetrators using illegal ingredient 'gelatin'... there were about 48 workers. My squad was able to arrest 39 workers,2 of which were undocumented illegal citizens". The CEO of Kraft will have a press conference on May 20th, where Ms. Rosenfeld is said to release an appology.
